        <p>
            This was my first time doing anything in HTML. That being said, this assignment was pretty easy 
            with the hardest part being how I wanted to organize the information (control the layout). From
            this assingment, I went in knowing nothing, and learned how to make a basic(HTML-only) web page.
            The resource that was the most helpful was the example code that we built in class.
